   You compile and install: ```mvn package```
   
   For testing: ```mvn test```
## Usage:

   There are three classes:
   Complex: It consist in the tipical operations on a Complex Number, such as, sum, multiply, rest, division, etc.
   Angle: It consist in the operations that can be done in an angle.
   ComplexMatrix: it consist in the operations betwin two matrix, such as, sum, rest, multiply, tensor, etc. All of this operation can 
   be done to a complex matrix (two of them).

## Double Slit Experiment;
   For the sake of basic concepts, it is going to be explained the simplest way possible. So, in physics, a light is pretty much a wave,    so when this laser beam of light passes through the two slits, it becomes two expanded waves. But waves have this behavior that when    they are overlapped, in some sections (depending of the position of both) they get cancelled. And because of that, it makes this        effect like there is a lot of slits that don´t exist. This has a more complicated mathemathical explanation, that to make it short,      the resulting probability of two complex numbers can be cero, something that doesn´t happen with only real numbers. This can be seen    in a test in this ver library!

## Prove:
   The configuration that we use is this one:

   As it can be seen, a laser that emits a strong light that goes through a wooden frame that in the middle is the double slit holes.      These holes are very small and ver close to each other.
   And the result is:

   The behavoir is exactly as it was describes earlier, a strange multiple-pattern has appeared in the wall! So that confirms the          strange way that quantum physics works.
