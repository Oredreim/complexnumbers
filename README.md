## Usage:
   There are three classes:
   Complex: It consist in the tipical operations on a Complex Number, such as, sum, multiply, rest, division, etc.
   Angle: It consist in the operations that can be done in an angle.
   ComplexMatrix: it consist in the operations betwin two matrix, such as, sum, rest, multiply, tensor, etc. All of this operation can 
   be done to a complex matrix (two of them).
